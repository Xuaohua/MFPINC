# MFPINC V1.1
**MFPINC - Open-source ncRNA identification tool** 

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are recognized as pivotal players in the regulation of essential physiological processes such as nutrient homeostasis, development, and stress responses in plants. Common methods for predicting ncRNAs are susceptible to significant effects of experimental conditions and computational methods, resulting in the need for significant investment of time and resources. Therefore, in this paper, based on the PINC tool for identifying ncRNAs proposed by our lab in 2022, a new model for predicting identified ncRNAs, MFPINC, was proposed, and sequence features were carefully refined using variance thresholding and F-test methods, while deep features were extracted and feature fusion was performed by applying the GRU model. The comprehensive evaluation of multiple standard datasets shows that MFPINC not only achieves more comprehensive and accurate identification of gene sequences, but also significantly improves the expressive and generalization performance of the model, and MFPINC significantly outperforms the existing competing methods in ncRNA identification.  

MFPINC is an open source tool, and we welcome supplements and suggestions from all sectors of society.

This is the basic version of the tool, and some errors may occur. I hope the user can inform me of any errors they may encounter, or provide a solution that can be added to the MFPINC basic code.

OTSO适用于Windows、Linux，但由于部分特征提取需要再Linux环境中进行，因此我们更推荐用户使用Linux系统使用我们的工具。下面是各种设备中安装MFPINC的说明。</br>
